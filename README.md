Goals and Expectations:

- The goal is to access how you approach adding a feature into an unfamiliar codebase
- You are allowed to use google to look up documentation and syntax
- While we encourage the use of AI in a work environment, you are not allowed to use AI for the interview

Task:

- Fetch transactions data from the server
- When you click into an account, you see the transactions data in a list for that account
- Discuss how we would approach this feature in a real world scenario and how it would scale
